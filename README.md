Tools to synchronise data between the ontology files and Wikibase instance for the Hercules project at University of Murcia.

## Directory structure
* docs: Development documentation of this module.
* hercules_sync: Source code of the application.
* tests: Test suite used to validate the project.

## Defining a webhook in the source repo
In order to perform the synchronization automatically, a webhook must be created in the original repository where the ontology is stored. This webhook will be launched whenever a new push event occurs in the repo, and the synchronization service will be called to sync the changes with the wikibase instance. When creating a new webhook, the payload url must point to the URL where this server will be available. It is also important to define a secret key that will be used to accept only requests from the source repo and not from other ones. An example configuration will look like this one:

## Launching the app with Docker
In order to execute the app you need to set the following configuration in the docker-compose.yml file:
* GITHUB_OAUTH: Github token with access to read the repository where the ontology is stored. This token will be used to download the modified files through the GitHub API. For more information, see [the official GitHub page about creating a personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
* WBAPI: Endpoint of the target Wikibase instance API where the ontology will be sincronized. E.g. https://hercules-demo.wiki.opencura.com/w/api.php
* WBSPARQL: SPARQL endpoint of the target wikibase. E.g. https://hercules-demo.wiki.opencura.com/query/sparql
* WBUSER: Username of the user that will perform the synchronization operation in the target wikibase.
* WBPASS: Password of the user defined by the username stated above.
* WEBHOOK_SECRET: Secret key of the webhook created in the previous step.
